# Brick-Breaker-Python
Brick breaker game in which there is a ball that bounces of a platform to break a brick wall and the player has to keep the ball going by making sure the paddle is always there to bounce off the ball back.

The game will have three layers of bricks, and each layer of brick will have a different hit capacity, which means some bricks will break in a single hit, some will require a double hit and some will require three hits.
