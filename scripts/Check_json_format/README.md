# 1 checkjson

This script will read a file and either pass the file as being a valid JSON file,
 or die a horrible death. But for all practical reasons, it tells me if the error is in the file or the program that I am trying to load the file into.

 ## to RUN it 

$ checkjson test.json

Thatâ€™s all you need to validate JSON, but it can easily be modified to validate YAML, as well.
