This script consist of python code which converts several PNG/JPG images to PDF.

It has several PNG/JPG images to use as examples. For different image just write url of different image which you want to use. If you want to increase or reduce the number of images you want to convert just add/subtract more lines for opening and converting, and add them to the list.

Write the location of the PDF to be saved at/ replace 'document.pdf' with the total url and name of pdf along with pdf extension.

I have used flake8 linting on this as well.

Dependency: Download python and write "pip install Pillow" in cmd.
