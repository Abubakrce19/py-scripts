# RSA ENCRYPTION ALGO IMPLEMENTATION IN PYTHON

- I've imported the rsa package.
- It generates the public and private key. 
- It then stores the keys in keys/privkey.pem and keys/publickey.pem.
- The keys are then loaded to the program as publickey and privatekey. 
- The inputed text or message is encrypted with the public key.
- Which then is put in the variable ciphertext. 
- The private key is used to decrypt the message. 
- Here we also verify the signature of the message and the keys, whether they are signified or not.
