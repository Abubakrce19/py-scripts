# Socket Progamming in Python

We all know how to use python for basic stuff and general programming. But this script allows you to create a server and client of your own using sockets. 

 # What are sockets? 
 
 A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to. An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.
