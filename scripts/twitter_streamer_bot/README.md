Here I used the twython library to use Twitter API, this library can be used to all the things mentioned in Twitter API document. 

## Prerequisites

Check [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), for twython check [here](https://twython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/install.html)
Generate your unique Twitter keys and token from [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en) by creating a [new app](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps).

## How to run the script
Update the keys and tokens in code.  
Run the python file and enter the keyword you want to track, now any new tweet will automatically liked and retweeted.
It will print the link of tweet<br>
